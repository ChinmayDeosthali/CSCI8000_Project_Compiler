# CSCI8000_Project_Compiler
Project: Write a simple compiler in C/C++.  Objective: Compiler is one of the core software in our system software stack. A vulnerable compiler can instrument malicious instruction in a binary. A compiler has two phases: front-end and back-end. In this project, we will write a simple compiler that will 1) read a code using stdin, 2) tokenize the source (lexical analysis), 3) check correctness of code (syntax analysis), and 4) generate a parse tree.
